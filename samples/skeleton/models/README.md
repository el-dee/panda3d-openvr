## Hand models

Models for the hands are not included in this demo. You must copy here the following two files from your SteamVR installation :

* vr_glove_left_model.glb
* vr_glove_right_model.glb

On Linux platforms, those files are located under `~/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/SteamVR/resources/rendermodels/vr_glove`.
On Windows platforms, those files are located under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\resources\rendermodels\vr_glove\`
